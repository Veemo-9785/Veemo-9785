"*What the f\*ck do you mean? I have been waiting for this day to come ever since I came out of the womb. I waited for Ayaka since day 1 to see her body right next to my Traveller. Everytime she touches me, I can feel her warmth. Every time she talks to me, I can hear her soft breath. Everything I look into her eyes, it awakens an ancient subliminal instinct deep inside of me. She keeps me alive. She keeps my blood flowing. Without Ayaka, I wouldn't be the same. She completes me. She is part of who I am. She is my identity. She is my presence. Without Ayaka, I am nothing more than a hollow husk without the presence of a soul. Ayaka is not just a character, she is my soulmate, we were destined to be from the very beginning. Don't you dare talk about her like that. Otherwise, you will face my wrath.*"
